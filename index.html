                        <h2>The Sun</h2>  
                        <p>The Sun is a giant ball of fire that keeps us warm and gives us daylight. It’s so big that one million Earths could fit inside it! Without the Sun, we’d be freezing in total darkness.</p>

                        <p>Mercury is the smallest planet and closest to the Sun. It zooms around the Sun faster than any other planet – it takes just 88 days to complete one year! But don’t get too excited—it’s boiling hot during the day and freezing cold at night.</p>

                        <p>Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus is actually hotter! It’s covered in thick clouds that trap heat, making it hot enough to melt metal! It also rains acid, so it’s definitely not a place for a vacation.

                        <p>Earth is the only planet we know that has life! It has water, plants, animals, and oxygen – all the things we need to survive. It’s also the only planet where you can order pizza and watch Netflix!

                        <p>Jupiter is so big that over 1,300 Earths could fit inside it! It also has a massive storm called the Great Red Spot, which has been raging for more than 300 years! Plus, Jupiter has over 90 moons – talk about a big family! </p>

                        <p>Saturn is famous for its beautiful rings made of ice and rock. It’s also so light that if you could find a giant bathtub, Saturn would float on water!</p>
